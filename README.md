<H1>Dr. Moska Hamidi (a professional site)</H1>
<P>This is the code for a professional website I designed for my sister, a Harvard-trained M.D. who currently works with Western University.
She wanted to have a personal site where she could showcase her opinions and also establish an online presence. I created the site first by sketching the designs and the general map for what should be included.
I did the design myself in Photoshop, then moving to coding everything out pixel-by-pixel. So, the header, the images, etc are all created by me as well. I went for a clean design and used Javascript's Angular states
to pull it all together and made it all responsive, too. The content is definitely going to be updated as the site has barely just started, but the code is all there!
